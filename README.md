***Vehicle Parking App***

It is a multi-user app (one requires an administrator and other users) that manages different parking lots, parking spots and parked vehicles. Assume that this parking app is for 4-wheeler parking.

These are the mandatory frameworks on which the project has to be built.

- Flask for application back-end
- Jinja2 templating, HTML, CSS and Bootstraps for application front-end
- SQLite for database (No other database is permitted)

Note: 
All demos should be possible on your local machine.
The database must be created programmatically (via table creation or model code). Manual database creation, such as using DB Browser for SQLite, is NOT allowed.
